# Screeps scripts

The repository contains all my scripts for the game [screeps](https://screeps.com/)

I'm using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?utm_expid=101350005-35.Eg8306GUR6SersZwpBjURQ.0&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.fr%2F) to edit my scripts.

# Auto-completion

In order to enable auto-completion you need to use [typings](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typings) to get Types definitions for the game API.

```
cd {FOLDER_ROOT}
npm install -g typings
typings install
```

You are ready to code your colony !
